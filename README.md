# check-yamlschema

A CLI and pre-commit hook for jsonschema validation in YAML files with multiple documents

Parse multi-documents YAML files, look for [inline schema comments][], and validate the documents according to their schema.

The inline schema comments should use the following format:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=<schema_url>
food: # Some YAML document
  - vegetables: tomatoes
  - fruits:
      citrics: oranges
      tropical: bananas
      nuts: peanuts
      sweets: raisins

      nuts: peanuts
      sweets: raisins
```

## CLI usage

- Install it with `pip install check-yamlschema`
- Run it with some YAML files in parameters: `check-yamlschema file1.yaml file2.yaml ...`
